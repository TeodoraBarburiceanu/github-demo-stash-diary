I arrived on site at 0700. Contactor excavating foundation for principal spillway conduit and placing earthll on
left half of dam. 0900 I checked foundation of principal spillway at two locations and asked contractor’s
surveyor Tom Gray for a copy of his principal spillway layout notes. He said he would provide a copy of his notes
to me tomorrow. 1100 Observed Inspector Michael Aldridge checking in-place moisture and density of ll
between stations 2+00 and 12+00. I discussed the need for him to pay particular aention to the moisture
and density of the foundation and ll where the ll joins the abutment. He agreed and conrmed ll at abutment
was not being compacted to the specied density. He discussed this with Forman Brown and Mr. Brown
directed the small compactor to the abutment area.1300 Mr. Aldridge informed me of the limits of
non-conforming ll and that it had been removed and replaced with ll that met density and moisture requirements. 1330 I noticed D6 dozer ran into fence at location approx. 200 feet downstream of dam Sta. 4+35.
Forman Brown and I drove to the location and Brown asked the operator to turn o the dozer and step away.
